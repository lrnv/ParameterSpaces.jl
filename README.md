---

`ParameterSpaces.jl` provides transformations between

- unconstrained optimization coordinates `θ ∈ ℝⁿ`, parameters of a given struct, and
- the continuous constrained parameters `η`, usable by an unconstraint optimisation routine,

together with analytic Jacobians.

It has been build at the start to associates distributions from
[`Distributions.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) with
unconstrained Euclidean parameter spaces suitable for numerical optimization.

The main convention is

```julia
p = param_space(object)
η = constrain(p, θ)
θ = unconstrain(p, η)
```

where `object` is the given struct. In particular, through its extension for Distributions.jl, all `object<:Distribution` from this package are supported.

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/lrnv/ParameterSpaces.jl")
```

Then:

```julia
using ParameterSpaces, Distributions
```

## Quick start

```julia
d = Gamma(2.0, 3.0)
p = param_space(d)

dimension(p)
# 2

parameter_symbols(p)
# (:α, :θ)

θ = [log(2.0), log(3.0)]

η = constrain(p, θ)
# ≈ [2.0, 3.0]

unconstrain(p, η)
# ≈ θ
```

The parameter-space object returned by `param_space` can generally be treated
as opaque. The exported interface is intended to be sufficient for downstream
optimization code.

## Public interface

### `param_space`

```julia
p = param_space(d)
```

Return the parameter space associated with a given object. Only `Distributions.jl` distribution
instance are provided through an extension.

The distribution instance matters because the dimension or structure of the
parameter space can depend on the distribution itself, for example for
`Dirichlet`, `Categorical`, `Multinomial`, multivariate distributions, and
mixture models.

If a distribution is not supported, `param_space(d)` throws an
`ArgumentError`.

### Dimensions

```julia
dimension(p)
constrained_dimension(p)
```

`dimension(p)` is the number of unconstrained optimization coordinates.

`constrained_dimension(p)` is the length of the constrained continuous
parameter vector returned by `constrain`.

For most parameter spaces the two are equal. They differ for constrained
manifolds such as a simplex.

For example:

```julia
p = param_space(Categorical([0.2, 0.3, 0.5]))

dimension(p)
# 2

constrained_dimension(p)
# 3
```

A categorical distribution with `K` probabilities has only `K - 1`
independent degrees of freedom.

### Parameter names

```julia
parameter_symbols(p)
```

Return names for the constrained continuous parameters.

```julia
p = param_space(Normal(0.0, 1.0))

parameter_symbols(p)
# (:μ, :σ)
```

Vector and matrix parameters are flattened and receive indexed names.

### Transformations

```julia
η = constrain(p, θ)
θ = unconstrain(p, η)
```

`constrain` maps unconstrained optimization coordinates to valid distribution
parameters.

`unconstrain` applies the inverse chart.

Round trips hold whenever the point is in the interior of the relevant chart:

```julia
θ ≈ unconstrain(p, constrain(p, θ))
η ≈ constrain(p, unconstrain(p, η))
```

### Jacobians

```julia
J = constrain_jac(p, θ)
Jinv = unconstrain_jac(p, η)
```

with

```math
J = \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial \theta}.
```

To avoid evaluating a transformation twice, use

```julia
η, J = constrain_with_jac(p, θ)
θ, Jinv = unconstrain_with_jac(p, η)
```

For maximum-likelihood optimization, if `gη` is the gradient with respect to
the constrained parameters,

```julia
η, J = constrain_with_jac(p, θ)
gθ = J' * gη
```

gives the gradient with respect to the unconstrained coordinates.

### Log absolute Jacobian determinant

```julia
logabsdet_constrain_jac(p, θ)
logabsdet_unconstrain_jac(p, η)
```

These are useful for change-of-variables calculations.

They are not required merely to optimize a likelihood after reparameterizing
its parameters.

For parameter spaces with rectangular Jacobians, such as a simplex,
`logabsdet_*` is intentionally undefined and throws an `ArgumentError`.

### Examples

```julia
θ = unconstrained_example(p)
η = constrained_example(p)
```

Return simple valid example points.

### Named constrained parameters

```julia
constrained_namedtuple(p, θ)
```

Example:

```julia
p = param_space(Gamma(2.0, 3.0))

constrained_namedtuple(p, [log(2.0), log(3.0)])
# (α = 2.0, θ = 3.0)
```

## Simplex-valued parameters

Probability vectors are represented using `K - 1` unconstrained coordinates
for `K` constrained probabilities.

```julia
d = Categorical([0.2, 0.3, 0.5])
p = param_space(d)

θ = unconstrained_example(p)
η, J = constrain_with_jac(p, θ)

length(θ)
# 2

length(η)
# 3

size(J)
# (3, 2)

sum(η)
# ≈ 1
```

The same principle is used for distributions such as `Multinomial` and for
mixture weights.

## Positive-definite matrix parameters

Positive-definite matrix parameters are represented through unconstrained
Cholesky coordinates.

For example, multivariate normal covariance or precision matrices are mapped
to a Euclidean vector while preserving positive definiteness after
`constrain`.

The constrained representation exposed by this package is flattened; use
`parameter_symbols` to inspect its ordering.

## Structural parameters

`param_space` describes the **continuous parameters to optimize**, not
necessarily every constructor argument of a distribution.

Discrete or structural parameters are intentionally omitted when appropriate.

Examples include:

```julia
Binomial(n, p)       # n is structural, p is optimized
Multinomial(n, p)    # n is structural, p is optimized
Erlang(k, θ)         # k is structural, θ is optimized
```

Likewise, truncation/censoring bounds, reshape dimensions, order-statistic
indices, and similar metadata are treated as structural by the corresponding
wrapper mappings.

A distribution may therefore legitimately have

```julia
dimension(param_space(d)) == 0
```

when it contains no continuous parameter to optimize.

## Boundary behavior

Finite unconstrained coordinates map to the interior of constrained domains.

Some inverse transformations also accept valid boundary values and map them
to infinite unconstrained coordinates. For example:

```julia
p = param_space(Bernoulli(0.5))

unconstrain(p, [0.0])
# [-Inf]

unconstrain(p, [1.0])
# [Inf]
```

This makes the constrained domain faithfully represent distributions that
allow boundary values while retaining an unconstrained Euclidean chart for
finite optimization coordinates.

## Coverage

The package contains mappings for a broad range of `Distributions.jl`
families, including:

- common continuous and discrete univariate distributions,
- ordered and bounded parameterizations,
- simplex-valued probability parameters,
- multivariate normal families,
- positive-definite matrix parameters,
- matrix-variate distributions,
- mixture models,
- product distributions,
- affine distributions,
- truncated and censored distributions,
- order-statistic and reshaped wrappers.

Coverage can be queried directly by calling `param_space(d)`. Unsupported
types fail explicitly instead of silently guessing a parameterization.

## Design goals

The package aims to keep the optimization-facing interface small:

```julia
p = param_space(d)

η, J = constrain_with_jac(p, θ)
θ = unconstrain(p, η)
```

The transformations and Jacobians are implemented analytically and the package
depends only on `Distributions.jl` beyond Julia's standard libraries.
